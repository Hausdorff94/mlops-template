# Data Science and MLOps Scaffold

## Overview

The Scaffold Project Template provides a standardized and efficient starting point for machine learning (ML) and data science projects. It is designed to streamline the setup process and promote best practices in project organization, code structure, and workflow.

## Why Use the Scaffold Project Template?

Using the Scaffold Project Template offers several key benefits:

1. **Consistency**: The template enforces a consistent structure and naming conventions across projects, making it easier for team members to understand and collaborate on different projects.

2. **Time Savings**: The template eliminates the need to set up project directories, boilerplate code, and common configurations manually. It provides a ready-to-use project structure, saving valuable time and effort.

3. **Best Practices**: The template incorporates industry best practices for ML project organization, including separating data, code, and model artifacts. It encourages modular and reusable code, making projects more maintainable and scalable.

4. **Reproducibility**: By following the template, projects are set up in a way that supports reproducibility. It captures dependencies, versions, and configurations, allowing others to recreate the project environment and obtain consistent results.

## About Cookiecutter

The Scaffold Project Template is built using Cookiecutter, a popular templating engine for project generation. Cookiecutter simplifies project initialization by allowing users to create custom project templates that can be easily customized and shared.

With Cookiecutter, you can generate a new project based on a predefined template by answering a series of prompts. These prompts help tailor the project structure and configurations to your specific needs, making it highly flexible and adaptable.

## Getting Started

To use the Scaffold Project Template, follow these steps:

1. Install Cookiecutter: [Cookiecutter Installation Guide](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

2. Generate a new project using the template:

    ```bash
    cookiecutter git@github.com:Hausdorff94/mlops-template.git --checkout main
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to customize the project settings, such as project name, author, and optional features.

4. Start working on your project! The generated project will have a preconfigured structure and initial files to get you started quickly.

## Project Structure

The Scaffold Project Template follows a recommended project structure, including directories for data, code, models, documentation, and more. The structure provides organization and clarity, facilitating collaboration and understanding within the project team.
